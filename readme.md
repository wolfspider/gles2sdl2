This is the android example merged with SDL2 code posted here: http://sdl.5483.n7.nabble.com/How-to-use-sdl2-with-libglesv2-dll-libegl-dll-angleproject-td35235.html

More than anything it is a good place to start for a cross-platform
graphics pipeline on Windows with MinGW GCC 4.8.1 and C++11. ANGLE was
built via the Qt project version 5.0.2 ANGLE/MinGW located here: http://qt-project.org/

Binaries in the lib folder are for deployment with your executable.
